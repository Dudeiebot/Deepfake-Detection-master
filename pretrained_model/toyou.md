You dont need to download the model cause it is like 70mb

The is the trained model being used to check if the video is fake and not real
I cant share the output of the video because it is bulky 
The output checks the video pixel by pixel to confirm if it is fake or not
I am using these method because it get to give more understanding regarding the algorithm usage

The pixel-level labeling can be used for forensic analysis. By highlighting manipulated pixels, experts can investigate and study the techniques used in the deepfake creation process.

An interactive approach allows users to explore the video and focus on specific regions or frames. This can be helpful for researchers, journalists, or anyone interested in analyzing deepfakes in more detail.


THe kind of main file is the detect_from_video.py
we install all packages on requirement.txt
these are all in the readme tho but i can explain more if you need
